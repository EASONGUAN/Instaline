# Instaline | Project-Team-01

### What we are planning to build:

* High-level description of the product :    
This is an Android application that provides a convenient, flexible and realtime lining platform between restaurants and customers which can be used everywhere at anytime.
* The Problem we are solving :  
When people decide to dine in a popular local restaurant at lunch/dinner time, they usually have to line up in front of the restaurant and wait for tables. A traditional way of lining up for a table, in general, is to walk in the restaurant in person and join the queue. However, this traditional lining up way actually comes with problems. Lining up at the scene brings huge potential time costs to diners, not to say on the restaurant side, it also requires labour, time and spared space to properly handle the manual line up system. Moreover, lining up for one restaurant usually means that one customer cannot line up for another one at the same time, which lessens the available choices for customers if there are many possible/better choices.



### Who our target users are:

In short, our target users are:
1. Customers who want to line up for restaurants, but it is not convenient for them to wait at the restaurant, or they want to line up multiple restaurants.
2. Restaurants do not want too many customs crowd at the entries.

Examples:
* Example 01 (Customs Side):  Bill is working on his project in BA, today is the last day before due. Now it’s lunch time, he wants to go to the PAI (a popular restaurant near King & University), he knows that there must be a lot of people waiting in line at this moment, how he wish he could save the waiting time on his project! He searches PAI on Instaline, it shows that his estimated waiting time is 55 mins, so Bill adds himself in the waiting list, goes back to lab and fixes some bugs then heads off to PAI when the app shows there’s only 20 mins wait.

* Example 02 (Customs Side):  On Sunday night, Bill is at home thinking of what to eat tonight, there are 4 super popular (have to wait outside) restaurants at four different directions, each one needs around 10-mins drive. it will be delightful if Bill can dine at any of them. Bill calls all of them, one of them say that they do not accept reservation, two say they can not queue Bill up over the phone, the other line is always busy. He is a little bit hungry and has no idea which one he should go to eat as soon as possible. He downloaded our app, register with his phone number and some basic info which takes 2 mins. He jumps in the end of each queue of these four restaurants. Then he goes to a shower. After about an hour, he gets a message showing that Restaurant A is ready for him in 20 mins. He picks up his jacket and drive to the restaurant. Once he arrives, the app cancels all other three
Lining-up. Bill has a great dinner and he decides to continue using the App Instaline.

* Example 03 (Restaurant Side): A new popular BBQ restaurant just opened at Spadina ave. Many BBQ lovers line up for this restaurant. One staff is assigned to do the registration for the waiting customers. However, the area of this restaurant is not large enough. The entrance gets more and more crowded, causing the doorway hard to get through. In the meantime, customers begin complaining about the service. Obviously the staff is too busy to take care of every customer. Some waiting customers even begin leaving. The restaurant owner wants to solve this problem and register his restaurant on the app Instaline. Now, they use our app Instaline to let their customs line up online. The people open the app and choose the restaurants they want to queue up. The staff who used to do the registration use the app as an administrator user to manage the queue. He notified the user about the upcoming available spot around 15 mins earlier. The entrance is not crowded anymore and customer feels happy entering the door. After a month, the popularity does not decrease due to the crowdedness. Users give good feedbacks and the manager is happy as well.

### Why would users choose our product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

* Nowadays, people use phone calls or physically visit the restaurants to see if restaurants have available seats other than reserved ones. If no seats are available, they have to physically line up outside the restaurants. This app allows users to see the realtime lining status without physically visiting the restaurants. It saves time for the users lining up outside the restaurants, and the waiting experience of customers in rainy and snowy days can be significantly improved. Customers can utilize their waiting time for shopping, entertainment or anything else. Moreover, users can get more and more accurate time estimates as time goes by. The app also provides users with a map of the popularity of the restaurants nearby based on preferences of majority.


### Highlights  

Alternatives that we discussed:  
* Car-Pooling Application: Users can pick up passengers who are heading to the similar destination, charging lower fees than Uber car pool; Comparing with Uber, customers can sacrifice some time and match drivers on similar route whose car has seats that can be utilized.
* Coursemate and Event Gallery Application: users are allowed to have online group chat rooms, group by the course code/major category, to find classmates, share opinions or find friends who took the same course etc easily. This app can also gather up, plan and share all your study events with coursemates.  
* Searcher of Nearly Expired Products: For customers, they can be informed with stores that are promoting products with soon expiry dates; for sellers, the sales amount of nearly expired products may increase.
* Course Seeker: Users can add their timetable and their interest major/area into this app, then it will generate a recommended course list without conflicting with user’s current timetable.
* Course Database: Because a lot of students care about his/her privacy when asking questions about courses on SNS, especially some materials like past exams, this app allows users to discuss course-related topic anonymously.

Reasons why we did not choose alternatives:
* Similar applications are already existing in the market. There are lots of carpooling applications on the internet. Coursemate and Event Gallery APP are similar to some sub-applications in facebook like facebook event and facebook groups.  
* The solution we provide to users is not specialized (i.e. developer cannot focus on solving a specific major problem). Coursemate and Event Gallery Application are intended to solve multiple problems at once, which will make the goal of the project unclear.  
* User demand is small because users are already satisfied with what they are currently using. In other words, the current solutions are sufficient and it's not necessary for them to switch to our new solution. Few people want to use Searcher of Nearly Expired Products since promotion products are not nearly expired products only, and users enjoy shopping and discovering discount items by themselves. The solution of Course Seeker can also achieve by just using U of T Acorn and Calendar, with a few more steps overhead but acceptable.
* Course Database may cause academic offence since some particular courses do not allow students to share/distribute course materials including notes and past tests.

### How we finally choose Instaline:   
We discussed five different alternatives, after analyzing each of them, we found they all have significant drawbacks. By comparing needs and features with Instaline, We finally arrive to a much more clear view of what we should develop. We've already discussed in detail above that the alternatives have drawbacks in different aspects. We also did some research on the application market, summarized opinions from friends and TAs, informally interviewed our friends as potential users, thought about how to effectively popularize Instaline. After all, we choose Instaline to be the ONE.  

### Why Instaline makes the most sense for our team:  
First, Instaline is a software whose most features are not currently existing in the market, which will provide a clear and specialized solution in order for us to absorb target users. We found that it has a large demand after doing researches as well as informal interviews. Second, Instaline is capable of providing a win-win solution for businesses as well as customers. Instaline is able to let customers line up virtually, and allow businesses to manage this virtual line efficiently. Last but not least, as a course project, it is suitable and especially beneficial for all students in University of Toronto.
